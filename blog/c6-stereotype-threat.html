			<br>For the sake of space, let's not handle the minutiae in this blog post: let's look at the big picture. The truth of Stereotype Threat is that everyone who has ever lived has felt it one way or another, but though it might be for different reasons and from different sources, people will usually react to it. Even choosing to ignore it is a reaction to it.<br>

			<br>To me, it's the fear of being something that you think people who don't know you think you ought to be. It's the fear of doing something and having people say, "Oh, that happened just because he/she is [insert nonsense here]" in response to it. Even writing this I'm feeling a it a little bit. As a white male I often feel like I don't have the right to talk about social pressure or prejudice, and when conversations turn in that direction while I'm talking with a diverse group of people I tend to take a back seat and not do as much of the talking. I worry I'll come off sounding insensitive or entitled if I give an opinion, and those worries are in turn unfair to the people around me who probably would treat what I have to say the same as they would treat anoyne else's opinion.<br>

			<br>But that seems to be the main outcome of Stereotype Threat: isolation, separation, or disconnection. You start making friends with people who are similar to you so that you don't feel that threat around them, or you keep your opinions to yourself in a room where everyone else is sharing them, or you simply behave separate from yourself in order to avoid falling into a stereotype. In that way, Stereotype Threat in fact scares people away from behaving as they would simply and robs them of a natural part of their identity through fear just because one of their group designations has that stereotype.<br>

			<br>So if the outcome of Stereotype Threat is isolation, separation, or disconnection, wouldn't overcoming Stereotype Threat involved some kind of collaboration, inclusion, or coagulation? Becoming more involved, and not shrinking away? The trouble is that this means facing your fears, and that's a tough order to fill sometimes when you're working on your own. That's why in some cases, a person feeling Stereotype Threat needs to be made to be especially involved in whatever situation instigated the threat. But that also means people will need to understand when someone might feel Stereotype Threat.<br>

			<br>The trouble with that is that unfortunately not everyone has been able to live every single kind of lifetime there is. We can only know as much as we've experienced and as much as we've been taught, because anything else is assumption. Teaching comes through listening and talking with people about their specific instances of Stereotype Threat so you can get closer to understanding the root of that specific kind, and once you understand it you can see the road signs coming and handle it when it gets to you, because simply diverting it is in fact a negative response to Stereotype Threat. Diversion has a very close relationship with isolation, separation, and disconnection.<br>

			<br>That means the goal is to learn, and learning comes from talking, an it comes from reading a few of these blog posts. Only by willfully facing Stereotype Threat head on can you over come it, because Stereotype Threat is a fear like any other terror and that's the only way to get rid of it.<br>
