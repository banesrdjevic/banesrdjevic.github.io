			You know, Phase 0 has been going pretty smoothly for me so far. There was a bit of a hiccup back at the beginning when I had to set up my PowerShell to work as it should, but I overcame that with gusto. I can't say I've felt any stress yet, but maybe I'm speaking too soon. Plus I don't have a full-time job working alongside the program, so I've got plenty of time to finish all of the assignments each week.<br>

<br>However, I haven't been as big a part of the community as I could be. Sure I've answered some questions and asked a few myself, but there's more to that, right? I mean not a lot more, granted, but there's definitely a group of people who are really making the most out of the DBC community on Google+. It's a great resource for getting questions answered, but the problem is that I don't like to ask a question until I feel like I'm up against a brick wall. I view questions as challenges, and finding the answer yourself is the only way to win. I thrive with a little competition, even if it's against a sentence on a page.<br>
<br>But that's a little strange though, considering I'm Abstract Random as far as my thinking style goes (at least after taking the test this last time). It says one of my problems is competition, but that's not true at all in my case. Granted, these designations aren't supposed to be 100% accurate. Then again, does me not asking questions to get answers faster count as a me thriving under competition or being hindered by it? What if that's not a healthy way to go about competition? Then again, is getting that answer as fast as possible the best way to get an answer? What if me taking the time to find it myself is increasing my own understanding of the concepts being presented? I've decided I'm going to consider myself awesome and just call it a day.<br>
<br>Let's say I wanted to learn how to approach competition differently. Now currently I don't want to change the equation because it's working wonders for me, but that doesn't mean I'm not open to ideas. An idea came to me that would help me get over this competition thing, and that's maybe pairing on every assignment with someone. That would slow my pace and I would be finding the answers together with someone rather than getting them from someone. This collaboration could ease some of the competitiveness out of the equation, but would that be the best thing for me? I mean it's worth a try to find out, and in fact I won't know until I try.<br>
<br>We'll see if I do.<br>
<br>Until then: Bane.
