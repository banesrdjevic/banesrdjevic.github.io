		<p class = paragraphs><br>The lack of computer literacy is among the top ten problems facing the tech world, I'd say. Biggest problem? Maybe, maybe not, but a crucial one without question. A basic level of computer literacy is a must these days. Can you imagine not knowing how to send an email? Well, some people don't have to imagine. I had a co-worker once who had over ten email addresses and was using all of them. When I asked them why, they said because they had to make a new one for each computer they ever used. This person didn't know that you can access an email address from any computer with an internet connection. That's the most basic level of understanding you need to even know how the Internet works!<br>
<br>This is an extreme case, but there are far too many people who don't know how to properly Google something or work a Word document in America alone, without even looking at the rest of the world. <br>
<br>I read an article recently from NBC that followed the story of a woman who had lost her job of almost 30 years and had to re-enter a work force that had left her in the past. She was nixed as a candidate for a lot of far-less demanding jobs than the one she had lost because she had no experience with computers, not to mention working spreadsheets or even navigating the Internet. So she enrolled in classes with a free nonprofit national job training organization to learn basic computer skills, and â€˜basic' here means learning to crawl for the first time. According to the article, the first thing they were taught how to do was turn on the computer. This didn't mean "All right class, turn on your computers and open up your project from last week," this meant "Do you see the circle with the stick coming out of it? Looks like a pencil poking the sun? When you push it the computer turns on."<br>
<br>This seems like it'd be a joke, but it's no laughing matter. Right now kids are learning how to type on keyboards instead of writing cursive in schools, and a lot of schools are even implementing basic coding classes for kids as young as seven. It's not too much of a stretch to say that in 20 years the average kid will have learned everything we'll learn in Dev Bootcamp by the time they finish high school. What does that mean for the 40 and 50 year olds who will be losing their jobs then because they can't keep up? Like the woman who lost her job and had to be taught how to turn on a computer?<br>
<br>The answer to this is simple although it isn't the easiest to do: make a basic level of computer-literacy a requirement like being able to read or doing basic algebra. Make it part of the core curriculum from grade school and onwards. Make more nonprofit organizations to help teach those who can't afford it, and then promote the resources people can use to learn everything they can. It's easy to say just put programming into the core curriculum from now on, but what does that mean for the people who are well out of school already? That won't do, so alternative methods for education are a must. A standard for computer literacy has to be set so that people are made ready for the jobs that they'll be needed for.<br>
