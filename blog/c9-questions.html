		One example that comes to mind actually happened fairly recently, and it happened for DBC. It wasn't a question I asked over Google+, but rather a suggestion I gave during a pairing session with one of my fellow classmates. The two of us were having internet problems and could only communicate through hangouts on our phones because out computers weren't getting an internet connection. So, in order to salvage the pairing session, I suggested the two of us compete and see who can finish three JS or Ruby challenges first. I figured this would simulate some crunch-time scenarios that we're sure to face at some point as web developers, but on top of that it would also be fun.<br>

		<br>I don't remember my exact wording, but I guess it wasn't clear enough. My pair didn't understand that I was suggesting we work separately on our own local repositories and kept arguing that it couldn;t be done because we didn't have internet for our computers. I in turn didn't want to push the subject after the misunderstanding and so we ended the pairing session.<br>

		<br>I guess looking back one of the fundamental problems of the question was that I was looking to change the standard, tried and true formula of pair programming without communicating it correctly. I didn't mention specifically that we would be working separately and I assumed the conclusion would have been jumped to on my partner's part, but you know what they say about assuming.<br>

		<br>Assuming is, after all, one of the main culprits of commiting miscommunication. Assuming causes a lot of gaps in between your and your fellow socializer's common ground and should be avoided at all costs. Likewise, specifics needs to be given in order to make sure that common ground is indeed being trodden upon by both parties. Looking at successfully answered questions on Stack Overflow quickly proves that, as questions that don't provide samples of code usually end up flat and unanswered.<br>

		<br>In the end, two lessons I learned from my experiences were 1) don't assume, and 2) be specific. That's the main lesson to be learned here.<br>
