			So, here at DBC we've so far been learning Ruby as one of our core languages. It's an Object_oriented Language that uses classes and other data storage and manipulation constructs to accomplish the goals of the coder, which in our case will ultimately be dynamite web design.<br>

			<br>But when you Google Ruby and web development, you'll come across Ruby on Rails, and if you search for jobs that involve Ruby you'll find titles like "Rails Developer" and not "Ruby Developer". Why is this, and what is the point of learning Ruby when there's something called "Rails" that seems to be getting all of the attention?<br>

			<br><b>What is Rails</b>
			<br>Rails is a web application framework. What this means is that it is a template of sorts (though one significantly more complicated than our blog templates) which developers use to make developing websites much, much easier. It isn't a language on its own, per-se, and it does require the developer to know Ruby in order to use it. That's why you'll usually hear the term "Ruby on Rails"--Ruby is the programming language you'll be using when working with Rails.<br>

			<br>But what does it mean to be a web application framework? Well, just like how our blog templates need the proper tags, titles, links, and syntax to work correctly and speed up the blog making process, so too does Rails provide a pre-fabricated environment to speed up web development. Have you ever opened up a repository and seen folders labeled "bin", "app", "doc", "lib", or otherwise? Well, these are all parts of most web applications, since there are a lot of files and folders needed to make a website run. Rails goes ahead and makes these as well as base code for each of them for you, saving you tons of time and energy. Then, using some special Ruby on Rails syntax you can interact with the web application much quicker. Just like how Ruby has a lot of methods built-in that JavaScript needs to have written out in order to use, so too does Rails make web development simpler.<br>

			<br><b><a href = "www.therailsway.com">The Rails Way</a></b>
			<br>As is the case with everything when it comes to programming, there are standard best practices that the professional world uses in order to streamline coding, efficiency, and readability. The set of rules for doing Rails right is called "The Rails Way", and clicking on the title of this section will take you to the site where you can explore some of the best practices and even buy the official book. Keeping up with what everyone else is doing is almost as important as knowing how they do it, so once you get working with Rails you'll want to study up on your best practices.<br>

			<br>This is a short intro into Rails and doesn't come anywhere close to describing everything that it does, but it's a good first step! Keep reading, keep practicing, and we'll all get there some day.
