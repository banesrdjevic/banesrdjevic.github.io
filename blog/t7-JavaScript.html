			Let's talk about hashes and objects. From the short time I've spent working with JS, I've already realized that my absolute number one favorite tool in this language is the Object, and I like it a lot more than the Ruby Hash.<br>

			<br>The reason I like it more is because of the syntax. JS Object syntax is a lot like Ruby Class Method syntax, which was also my favorite part of Ruby syntax. Here's what I'm talking about:<br>

			<br>Get a JS Object Value:
			<br><code>object.value</code></br>

			<br>Call a method from a Ruby Class:
			<br><code>r_class.method</code></br>

			<br>and if the method was made as an attr_reader, it's pretty much the same thing! And if you want to change it:<br>

			<br>JS:
			<br><code>object.value = change</code></br>

			<br>Ruby:
			<br><code>r_class.method = change</code></br>

			<br>it's like they're attr_writer methods! Oh yeah, it's all coming together now.<br>

			<br>Granted the Ruby Class can do more than the JS Object (as far as I know) but it's still exciting stuff.<br>

			<br>The Ruby Hash on the other hand I always found unnatural to work with. It doesn't seem as easy to manipulate as the JS Object is, but might again just be because of the syntax. But looking a bit into what the future holds, I see that what we've been using thus far has just been object literal notation, but apparently constructor functions will make things much more interesting.<br> 

			<br>They'll also be bringing inheritance into the picture, and I guess that means that in fact while hashes and JS Objects might seem similar, they are in fact very different and JS Objects may end up having more in common with Ruby Classes than Ruby Hashes. Only time will tell.<br>
