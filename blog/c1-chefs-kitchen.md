"It only works if..."

Somewhere in the wee hours of September 19, 2014

"It only works if everybody walking in through the door says 'This is my program, these are my 9 weeks, I'm going to make them amazing, get out of my way!'"

While I'm not goint to be as forward about all of this as Shereef put it in the video, I know that despite how awesome everyone is going to be and how awesome working together is going to be, I need to take the reins for myself and make the program what I want it to be. And what do I want it to be? I want it to be an immersive community of open-minded people looking down the same path put traveling down their own branches. That's what I want it to be, and from what I can see that's exactly what Dev Bootcamp is supposed to be.

I want to learn how to do, you know? I've been a contract writer for the past few years and while I've been getting by all right with that, I really want to get my hands on a trade skill that I can put to work not only in the job market but for myself as well.

I like to create. I like to write. I like to create stories, and I like getting people engaged in those stories, and so one day I asked myself "What is the most engaging medium out there today?" The internet, of course! And a medium is a way to tell a story, so I decided the internet was destined to be my next playground.

But there lay the problem, the crux of the matter--I didnt know how to code. And if I don't know how to code then I can't write my stories on the internet. I could get them on there, all right, but someone else would be writing them, and I was not about to sit around and wait for someone else to do something for me that I know I could do myself if I just took the time to learn it. So that's why I'm here, and that's why here is Dev Bootcamp.

I wanted to learn as quickly as possible, and yeah I got to working on my own with my own free time, but six months in (an eventhough I had already programmed mock copies of cookie clicker and 2048, which was really cool) I still felt like I should have been able to do that faster. So I started looking at bootcamps to see what all of the hubbub was about. And it was a lot of good hubbub.

There are a lot of camps out there, and truth be told it was a close race between Dev Bootcamp and the Starter League. Starter League had some serious charm to it, don't get me wrong, but what finally sold me for Dev Bootcamp was the intensity. I wanted to be in as fast paced a program as I could find, and I wanted to thrive under that pressure. Deadlines are a writer's best friend, after all, and working in a fast paced environment where I'm behind the wheel is familiar territory for me, but I wanted to see just how fast I could push it.

And so far (meaning week one) DBC has not disappointed. I'm learning a lot faster than I did on my own, and I feel like I'm always working and I love that feeling. But what was surprising is that all of this learning, though structured and curricularized by you lovely people, was done by me, through my own efforts to complete the challenges. While the DBC Google+ community is an awesome resource and an awesome place, I like to see how far I can get towards solving a problem on my own before piping up for some help. I mean I will when I have to, but the challenge has always been a motivator for me--hence my portfolio of video games I've 100%-ed. It's also the reason why I can't play MMOs--I'd never be seen again.

Learning by putting in the effort to get the challenges done is the fastest way I learn--always has been and always will be. I'm getting goosebumps thinking about how it will be once the intensive starts, and I'm all about coming in with that "kitchen mindset."

Here's to making some killer souffles together.
