I've found that my most enjoyable pairing sessions have been the ones where I have already completed the assignments and helped others work through the logic of their own code to get to their own answers. While they get to complete the assignment, I get to figure out a new way to do something that I have already done. It gets me thinking in other directions, learning new methods, and seeing what kind of thinking leads to those kinds of answers. It's all very interesting to me, and I think I actually learn the most from these kinds of pairing sessions.<br>
<br>However, the opposite is true when I haven't completed the assignment myself beforehand. I have no problem working with someone to complete a task, but when it comes to pairing I'm not just working on an assignment -- I'm learning. When I work with someone else, I feel like I have to curb my natural learning style in order to not seem too pushy in the pairing session. I like to jump from resource to resource rapidly and I need to read things on my own to fully understand them, and sometimes that's hard to communicate without me feeling like a jerk. Getting the assignments done is no problem, but it takes me a lot longer to learn the competencies in the meantime. I'll see what I can do to change it though.<br>
<br>Feedback is a great tool, I think. I've been really happy with a lot of the pairing feedback I've gotten, and reading it has helped me streamline how I pair with others. For the better, too. I get to see what I need to improve and what I'm good at from an outside perspective, and that gives me a wider perspective, ya know? For example, I need to work on my speed and pace. I tend to jump a few steps ahead, so I need to slow down and break each code down with my pair. I keep this in mind, too, when I write my own feedback. I know that people read it and take them very seriously, and writing the wrong thing could inhibit someone from performing their best in future pairing sessions. It isn't very difficult, but it is something I take very seriously.<br>
<br>Overall, this whole pairing and feedback system has been a great addition to Phase 0. We are all working together and we'll get to know each other more once we get into the office, but communicating with each other through feedback, pairing sessions, and Twitter have actually made me feel closer to the people in the program. I say keep it going, and we'll keep figuring out how to make it work best for everyone.<br>
