			When I was a young boy, a friend and I would play games, pretending we were wizards and warriors and what not. One day my older brother joined in, and things didn't end so well. I had been using a stick as a sword the whole day and had become really attached to it, but I had to leave it on the ground when my brother suggested my friend and I climb the roof.<br> 

			<br>We climbed, my brother didn't, and then he tried to goad us into jumping off. I was afraid and didn't want to, so my brother started smashing my things, starting with my bike. That, the basketball, the hot wheels, and the little Home Alone recorder I had gotten didn't phase me, but when he grabbed my sword stick and broke it, I snapped with it. I quite literally ran off the roof and started chasing him around the neighborhood with a metal pipe I had found somewhere. My mother was none too pleased.<br>

			<br>In retrospect, this was probably not the correct response, but I was too young for reason back then. Honestly though I don't know what the correct response would have been. If someone is breaking your things, what would you do if you couldn't call the police to have it handled?<br>

			<br>The source of the conflict was essentially my brother being a little snot and trying to get a rise out of me, and I definitely didn't help the situation by going above and beyond a rise. It wasn't handled too well, and maybe if I had gone straight to my mom I could have gotten my brother in trouble and my friend off the roof. But I figure people should solve their own problems when they can. Granted in my situation the conflict escalated and did in fact get worse, especially for my poor friend on the roof who had to watch me chase my brother down with a metal pipe while my screaming mother in turn chased me. It could have gone better.<br>

			<br>Today, I would probably not react as aggressively as I did then. I was a bit of a hot head as a kid, and I think I'm relatively chilled out now compared to then. Plus, there are far more drastic penalties for someone my age chasing a kid down with a metal pipe these days. But in all seriousness, a calmer approach would have been better. I still would not be happy that my brother was smashing up my toys for no reason, but I'd try to find a way to get him to stop being such a jerk. Getting my mom or, even worse, my dad involved would have set him straight real quick. Or I could have gone the route of passive aggressivenss and just silenced him with some quiet, crazy-eyed intimidation. But the too-literal version of "Attack Other" from the Compass of Shame that I put to use was definitely not the way to do it.<br>

			<br>Fast-forwarding to today though, if there was someone my age behaving the same way towards me there would be nothing to do other than contact someone to have them taken away. When someone is senselessly attacking you for no reason other than to get a rise out of you, that rise will usually get you into more trouble than they'll end up in. That's the ultimate lesson from all of this. <br>

			<br>Keep Calm and Put the Pipe Down.
