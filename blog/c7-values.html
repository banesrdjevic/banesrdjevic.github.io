			Taking a look at some of my fondest memories, there are a few that stand out among the rest. Unfortunately, they're my own so I won't be sharing them, but they do all share a common thread as far as the values listed go, and I do feel fine about sharing that thread. Take a look, fellow spinsters:<br>

			<br><b><u>Courage</u></b>: The kind of courage I'm talking about here is the fight or flight kind. When you're put on the rack will you choke up or fight the good fight. Knees weak, arms heavy, mom's spaghetti and all that. When something truly important is on the line, will you have the courage to fight for it?<br>
			
			<br><b><u>Leadership</u></b>: Leadership isn't necessarily about leading, in my opinion. It's about showing the way, even when others are adamant in walking down the wrong direction, even if you're the only one looking down that road. It's standing up to do what needs to be done when others don't even know what's going on.<br>
			
			<br><b><u>Helping Others</u></b>: This is the only straight forward one to me. You help people, and that's all there is to it. Don't even do unto otherrs as you would have them do to you: don't think about it and just help them out. <br>
			
			<br><b><u>Insight</u></b>: Read the situation and grasp the environment before you make a leap in any direction, because though cliches are never to be used, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Sometimes.<br>
			
			<br><b><u>Excitement</u></b>: If you're not getting excited about it, or if you don't feel your stomach tying itself in knots, what's the point?<br>

			<br>But do I try to live up to these values by living my life? The answer is yes, but the keyword here is "try". I don't always succeed, but there is a thought there and I think it counts for something. Even more so when I make it work.<br>

			<br>But although I associate all five of these values with some of my happiest and proudest memories, insight is the one I truly value the most. Without insight, all of the others fall to the wayside. Even helping others. How are you supposed to help someone if you can't read the situation? And if you can't read the situation you can miss out on a lot of opportunities to help those in need.<br>

			<br>Clearly I'm segwaying into a comment on combating Stereotype Threat here, so the wait is finally over: insight is what's needed most when combating Stereotype Threat. You have to be aware of what it is and you need to be able to think outside of yourself to understand what people are feeling within themselves, you know? But that takes active practice to get it done. That's the exercise I want to practice when I'm at DBC. Along with coding, of course.<br>
