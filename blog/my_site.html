			My site has been an interesting experience. While I did discover that I am much more suited to logic based programming and need to take some extra special time to work on HTML and CSS, it has been interesting in that the whole time I was supposed to be working on my current site, I found myself planning and creating a new site for myself. It's a lot more complex than the fairly static one I have up right now, but when it's done it'll be something special.<br>

			<br>Until the grand unveiling, however, the current site I've had up has been a great exercise in learning about what does into a website and what makes it tick. I've been doing some research on Jekyll and Bootstrap, for example, and learning what I can from them, but I honestly think the kind of websites I want to build in my free time won't be run on those frameworks. I want more malleability, and those set too many things in stone. No, for the things I will be doing for fun I will absolutely be coding it on my own. I just need some more practice with CSS animations and a touch more knowledge about jQuery.<br>

			<br>But looking at other student's sites has been a great experience. Each person has their own tastes and flavors when it comes to design, an the cumulative product has become a tapestry. I like both the super simple designs as well as the really elaborate ones with pictures and flashing colors and everything else that goes with it. And I liked giving people feedback and asking them questions.<br>

			<br>What's intersting now though is that I feel a lot more comfortable using the inspect element feature in browser, and I'm getting a lot of great ideas for site design from some of my favorite sites. I think it's absolutely great that CSS and HTML are pretty much open source for whoever visits the site. It's a very progressive thing, and I can't wait to add some of my work to it.<br>

			<br>Anyways, HTML and CSS are my weakness, I am sure of that, but I'll get better at them with time. That's how it goes with everything, and I'll just have to put a little extra work into perfecting those two.<br>
