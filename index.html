				My name is Bane Srdjevic and I'm just now dipping my feet into the world of programming. I come from a background of international travel, having spent a fairly extravagent amount of time in countries that aren't the United States. My most recent getaway has been Japan for the past year, and just like with my past adventures I have brought something home from Japan that I keep to myself, though if you're paying attention you'll notice it in everything I do.<br>

				<br>I believe in a person being the sum total of their experiences, and I'll surely be bringing my experiences with me everywhere I go.
