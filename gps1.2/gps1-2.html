            <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
            <p>Pair programming is two or more people coming together to work 
            on a project. This enables faster proofing as well as a faster way 
            to join ideas. Plus, one person might be strong where another 
            is weak and vice versa, in which case they would learn from 
            each other.</p>
            <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
            <p>Pair programing is important to DBC because it offers a chance
                to practice collaborative programming in a real-world setting.
                Plus, DBC encourages learning from each other as much as learning
                from the staff.
            </p>
            <h3>Compare Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <p>The navigator holds the idea for the programming session in their
                head and describes what they want to the driver. This allows the
                driver to focus on the code and not worry about strategy, and 
                vice versa.
